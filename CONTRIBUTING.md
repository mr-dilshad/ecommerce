## **Testing Guidelines**  

1. **Unit Tests**:  
   - Backend: Use JUnit5/Spring Boot Test.  
   - Frontend: Use Jest or React Testing Library.  

2. **Integration Tests**:  
   - Mock external services using tools like **Mockito** or **WireMock**.  

3. **E2E Testing**:  
   - Use tools like Cypress or Playwright for testing user flows.
