# **Product Roadmap**

## **Overview**  
This roadmap outlines the process for identifying and resolving gaps or missing features in [Shopizer](https://www.shopizer.com/) to create a fully functional, cloud-ready eCommerce platform. The end goal is to deliver a well-documented, deployable solution with seamless cloud integration, ensuring developers can build scalable eCommerce platforms efficiently.

---

## **1. Feature Gap Identification**  

### **a. Review Shopizer Components**  
We will perform an in-depth review of all Shopizer components:  
1. **Backend APIs**  
   - Validate endpoints for completeness (e.g., order management, cart functionality, payment integration).  
   - Identify missing REST APIs needed for enterprise-level workflows.  

2. **Frontend Application**  
   - Test for user experience (UX) gaps, performance issues, and missing functionalities (e.g., search, filters, lazy loading).  

3. **Admin Portal**  
   - Check for gaps in management features like product uploads, role-based access control (RBAC), order analytics, and dashboards.  

---

### **b. Validation with Real-World Use Cases**  
We will simulate end-to-end eCommerce workflows to identify limitations:  
1. **Customer Journey**  
   - Browse products, search, add to cart, checkout, and process payments.  
   - Test scenarios for product reviews, wishlists, and notifications.  

2. **Admin Workflow**  
   - Product management (bulk upload, inventory tracking).  
   - User role management.  
   - Order and shipping dashboards.  

3. **Cloud Readiness**  
   - Verify compatibility with cloud-native deployments:  
     - Scalability (horizontal scaling).  
     - Stateless behavior for APIs and frontend components.  
     - Centralized logging and monitoring.

## **2. Resolving Identified Gaps**  

### **a. Backend API Enhancements**  
- Add missing REST APIs for:  
   - **Wishlist and Notifications**: User notifications for order updates.  
   - **Advanced Search**: Full-text search and filtering.  
   - **Payment Gateway Integration**: Support for Stripe, Razorpay, and PayPal.  
   - **Shipping Integration**: APIs for integrating with shipping providers like FedEx or UPS.  

- **Optimization**:  
   - Improve query performance and add caching (Redis).  
   - Add rate limiting for API security.

---

### **b. Frontend Application Improvements**  
- **Missing Features**:  
   - Add advanced search and filter UI.  
   - Build a responsive and mobile-friendly product page.  
   - Implement lazy loading for faster load times.  
   - Integrate product review and ratings system.

- **Performance Optimization**:  
   - Optimize API calls using debouncing.  
   - Add client-side caching.  

---

### **c. Admin Portal Enhancements**  
- Add enterprise features to the admin portal:  
   - **Bulk Upload**: CSV/Excel support for bulk product uploads.  
   - **RBAC**: Implement role-based access control (e.g., admin, editor, and viewer roles).  
   - **Dashboard Analytics**: Build sales and inventory analytics dashboards.  
   - **Order Management**: Simplify shipping tracking and status updates.  

---

### **d. Cloud Integration**  
- Ensure the project is **cloud-ready**:  
   - **Containerization**: Provide Docker support for backend, frontend, and admin portal.  
   - **Cloud Databases**: Integrate Amazon RDS, Azure SQL, or Google Cloud SQL.  
   - **File Storage**: Add support for cloud storage like AWS S3 for product images.  
   - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployments.

---

### **e. Documentation**  
- Improve existing documentation with:  
   - Detailed API guides with **Swagger/OpenAPI** documentation.  
   - Step-by-step **deployment instructions** for cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP).  
   - Architectural diagrams explaining the project components.  
   - Troubleshooting FAQs and edge case handling.  

---

## **3. Testing and Validation**  

### **a. Comprehensive Testing**  
- Add **unit tests** for all new features.  
- Write **integration tests** for backend APIs using Postman or WireMock.  
- Implement **end-to-end (E2E) testing** for frontend using Cypress or Playwright.  
- Include **performance testing** for API endpoints and frontend responsiveness.
